## Scalability experiments

<div align="justify" class="text">
Scaling experiments are crucial for assessing code scalability and parallel performance. They involve systematically varying computational resources to gain insights into code behavior under different workloads. These experiments provide valuable information, identify limitations, and drive improvements.
</div>

<div align="justify" class="text">
Results serve two key purposes. Firstly, they diagnose code performance by analyzing execution times and speedup as resources increase. This helps identify bottlenecks and optimize code for better performance.
</div>

<div align="justify" class="text">
Secondly, scaling results are necessary for resource allocation requests. Funding agencies require evidence of code scalability and performance to assess resource requirements and potential impact.
</div>

<div align="justify" class="text">
Visualizations like speedup and efficiency plots effectively present scaling results. They illustrate execution time improvement and resource utilization effectiveness.

<div align="justify" class="text">
In conclusion, scaling experiments are vital for understanding code scalability and parallel performance. They inform optimization efforts and support resource allocation requests. Visualizations aid in communicating results effectively.
